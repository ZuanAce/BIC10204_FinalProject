# My First Ever Programming Project ðŸš€ 
# BIC10204_FinalProject
This group project, involving three members, is a practical application of the theories learned in algorithm and programming coursework. The objective is to solve programming questions using C programming language, demonstrating proficiency in coding, problem-solving, and creativity. The project also requires us to apply as many C programming theories that we have learnt.
solving the question.

# Theories Applied
- Functions: Utilized functions to encapsulate logic, specifically the calBMR function for calculating BMR and DCR based on user inputs.
- Control Structures: Employed if, else if, and else statements to manage different conditions such as gender and level of activity.
- Pointer Usage: Utilized pointers within calBMR to store and return calculated BMR and DCR values back to the main function.
- Input/Output Operations: Used scanf for user input (name, age, weight, height, gender, level of activity) and displayed outputs (BMR, DCR, calorie requirement).
- Mathematical Formulas: Applied formulas considering weight, height, age, gender, and activity level for BMR and DCR calculations.
- Preprocessor Directives: Included necessary header files (stdio.h, string.h, stdlib.h) via #include directives.
- Error Handling: Implemented error handling for invalid inputs using printf for error messages and exit(0) to terminate the program.
- Comments: Provided comments throughout the code to clarify function purposes, calculations, and user prompts for improved readability and maintenance.

# Output Description
The input of this program is to allow users to enter their name, age in year, weight in kilograms (kg), height in centimetres (cm), gender and level of activity. The output of this program is to execute the correct answer for Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Daily Calorie Requirement (DCR) based on the value entered by the user. At the same time, the input data of the users (name, age, weight, height, gender and level of activity) will also be displayed at the output of the program. Below shows some of the sample outputs.

To elaborate more, if the gender input is not equal to female or male, then the program will eventually terminate itself. Same goes to the level of activity, if the user input value does not meet the requirement, the program will be terminated. For instance, example 2 shows the sample output that is invalid as a result of the user not inputting the value in between 1-5 for level of activity. Example 3, on the other hand, shows an invalid output due to the gender input not equal
to female or male.
